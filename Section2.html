                <h2>Section B: Garfield Park</h2>
                <p>Garfield Park is a neighborhood located on the West Side of Chicago, Illinois, (shown below in Figures 2 and 3).

                <p> Some neighboring towns are Oak Park, Humboldt Park, and Homan Square. The Garfield Park Neighborhood is roughly 2 square miles. The center of the town features a park that includes a conservatory. Today, Garfield Park has a lower class demographic, median household income is 21K per year. There is a high crime rate, HIC survey participants asked how common violence is in their community: 65% said “extremely” or “very” <a href="www.niche.com/places-to-live/n/garfield-park-chicago-il/residents/." target="_blank">(Niche, 2016). </a> The population has dropped dramatically since the mid 1900s, from 63K to 37K. Garfield Park is 91% African American. There are two education systems, Urban Prep Academics and Providence St. Mel School. Only 29% percent of the community says there is a strong sense of community <a href="www.niche.com/places-to-live/n/garfield-park-chicago-il/residents/." target="_blank">(Niche, 2016)</a>.

                <h2>Need Assessment of Garfield Park</h2>
                <p>The Garfield Park neighborhood, including its centerpiece park and lagoon, was originally called Central Park. Irish and German railroad workers who worked for the Galena and Chicago Union Railroad were responsible for the neighborhood's settlement. After President James A. Garfield's assassination in 1881, the park and its surrounding neighborhood were renamed to honor President Garfield. The neighborhood's landmark conservatory, known as Garfield Park Conservatory, was completed in 1907. In the early 1900s, the construction of the Lake Street CTA train stop brought new commercial development to the neighborhood. "By 1930, the population was more than 63,000.  But the Depression and World War II took a toll on the community. By 1947, the area was so needy that the Daughters of Charity opened Marillac House to serve the poor, an institution still serving the community today" <a href="http://www.gpcommunitycouncil.org/About6.html " target="_blank"> (Garfield Park Community Council, 2018d, para 4). </a>
                </p>
                <p>
                The Garfield Park area suffers from flooding issues, “Flooding is the main environmental hazard in the region, accounting for 41 percent of disaster losses in Illinois and over $195 million in FEMA payments since 1978. In Chicago, the West Side is by far the most susceptible to water damage and flooding” <a href="https://freespiritmedia.org/features-search/2018/4/12/flooding-not-food-city-inclined-to-fund-east-garfield-park-orchard-because-of-potential-to-mitigate-stormwater-damage 
                " target="_blank"> (Sabino, 2018b). </a> 
                    
                The city of Chicago made an investment this year by helping fund an “Eco Orchard,” which, in the long run, will decrease the water damage in the area. This “Eco Orchard” also offers a plethora of healthy food options, something the town didn’t have much of before. The orchard, costing $1 million, will decrease the cost of damage substantially, “According to the 2015 report produced by the city for the Resilient Revitalization project, water damage to sewers, homes and commercial properties cost an average of over $8 million per year in Garfield Park. The same report found that $4.8 million of those damages can be mitigated by various green infrastructure projects that absorb water before it can overflow the sewer system and flood people’s homes and businesses”<a href="https://freespiritmedia.org/features-search/2018/4/12/flooding-not-food-city-inclined-to-fund-east-garfield-park-orchard-because-of-potential-to-mitigate-stormwater-damage" target="_blank"> (Sabino, 2018b). </a>  
                    
                Another establishment that received funding was the Garfield Park Conservatory. They are partnered with multiple Chicago organizations and receive generous donations to go towards renovations. Both the Observatory and Eco Orchard open up more jobs as well as more opportunity for Garfield Park, ultimately benefiting the economy.  Besides the Conservatory, a main institution that represents the community. Garfield Park is represented by several other institutions including the Garfield Park Community Council and the Garfield Park Community Worship Center. These three institutions each focus on different aspects  Council members and the Conservatory create awareness campaigns to raise money for the community. They host fundraisers and oversee multiple community programs and groups such as their resident leadership program <a href="www.gpcommunitycouncil.org/GPCC-Programs/Public-Safety.html." target="_blank"> (Garfield Park Community Council, 2018c). </a>

                </p>
                <p>The Garfield Park Community Council is a group of people in the Garfield Park area that are dedicated towards putting their efforts into making Garfield Park a better place for residents. They are a community-building organization of dedicated residents and allies working together to develop leaders and create  opportunities and programs that build a vital Garfield Park community. This group is an influence within the community and makes sure that people’s voices are heard and things that need to be done within the community are addressed. That being said, this council, just like any other city council, they hold meetings that are open to the community where members of the community can go to have their voices heard. This is a big way in which Garfield Park addresses issues and where community members needs can be met. They also have a website where people can go to see upcoming events, their past, current and future projects as well as when these meetings are held. Aside from the website, they also have a Facebook page that corresponds with the updates posted on their website.  Their Facebook serves as a secondary platform for people to receive information fast, as well as communicate with members of the council to address issues and concerns. The community uses multiple Facebook pages to stay connected and talk about community issues. The different pages vary in tone depending on the issues covered. The Community Council group and the Conservatory groups are more professional and discuss events in the area. While the community group discusses issues such as gentrification, and provides a place for community members to voice their concerns. The Facebook pages are crucial for community communication because the neighborhood does not have its own news source (the Chicago Tribune and ABC7 Chicago currently cover the news in the area).

                <h2>Impact on Public Opinion</h2>
                <p>Table 1.</p>

                <p>
                The neighborhood of Garfield Park is currently working to combat prominent issues in the community that affect their public opinion, such as being known as a low income neighborhood with high crime rates. They are doing this through the use of community resources like the Hatchery, their Community Council, the Conservatory, the Chicago Lawyers’ Committee for Civil Rights, their Municipal Council, and the Chicago Police Department. The table (above) depicts the main issues the community is facing, how they are combating these problems, and the resources they are using for each (Table 1). 

                </p>
                
                <p>“The Hatchery Chicago is a nonprofit food and beverage business incubator, which enables local entrepreneurs to build and grow successful businesses” <a href="https://thehatcherychicago.org/ " target="_blank"> (Hatchery, 2018, para 1).</a> They are located in the same building as Advocate Creative, and have successfully helped businesses in the neighborhood to grow and prosper, like Trini’s Tasty Pastries depicted in Figure 5. 
                </p>
                <p>The Hatchery also currently offers a number of free classes for members of the Garfield Park community (see figure 6 below). These opportunities allow community members to acquire skills to help them secure a job. The Hatchery also has many job opportunities, within the company, that are available to community members, like the posting featured in Figure 7. These activities create economic and social growth in the neighborhood. The goal of the Hatchery is to start by increasing the employment and skills of the community members. Then see growth in the communities small businesses through their incubator services, and eventually establish the community as a place for businesses to grow and prosper.

                    The Chicago Lawyers’ Committee for Civil Rights is another organization assisting the growth of small businesses in the community. The organization “helps to build, strengthen, and support community-based organizations that are focused on economic development in Chicago’s low-income neighborhoods and offer the delivery of social services to residents of these areas. [They] bring hope to impoverished neighborhoods by supporting small businesses and home ownership”     
                    
                    <a href="https://www.clccrul.org/community-law-project/" target="_blank">(Chicago Lawyers’ Committee for Civil Rights, 2018).</a> This resource can help the community to grow their current small businesses, attract new small businesses in the future, and ultimately lead to increased income and strongly established small businesses in the community.

                <p>The Garfield Park Community council is also making strides toward bettering the community. The neighborhood faces the dangers of gentrification and the council is making efforts to keep the community members informed, involved, and in discussion. They do this through use of their website, where they offer access to a free gentrification toolkit, and through community forums and facebook discussions on the subject  <a href="http://www.gpcommunitycouncil.org/Resources4/Housing.html." target="_blank"> (Garfield Park Community Council, 2018b). </a>
                </p>
                <p>
                   The Garfield Park Municipal Council recently announced the approval of a plan to build 114 new apartments in the neighborhood as an attempt to bring new income and new residents into the neighborhood to improve their low income status. This plan has already affected public opinion, an article by Chicago Business describing this plan, and how it will revive a desolate part of the neighborhood, was run in August of this year. The website has averaged upwards of 900,000 visits in the past 6 months and therefore this article has received engagement not only within the community, but also with other parts of the Chicago, affecting public opinion on the neighborhood<a href="www.similarweb.com/website/chicagobusiness.com." target="_blank"> 
                    (Similar Web, 2018b). </a> Although this plan will benefit the community it brings up the concern of supporting gentrification. However, “because the project will be built on vacant land… ‘nobody will be displaced when new people come in,’ [and] the project [will] avoid the push-out effect that gentrification often brings”

                </p>
                <p>
                     These steps being taken by the community, through the use of community resources are beginning to change public opinion of the neighborhood and invite more positive mentions of the neighborhood in local media.

                <h2>Social Power Analysis</h2>
                <p>
                    Advocate Creative has a strict set of expectations for their clientele. All of their partnerships must be with nonprofits that are “highly effective organizations with a proven track record, that are doing vital work in an innovative way, and looking for experts to lead an intentional creative process”  <a href="https://advocatecreative.com/about-us/" target="_blank">(Advocate Creative, 2018a, para 3). </a>  Because of this, the media outlet does not take risks in communicating with the community. They stand by these standards regarding potential clients, most of which are not part of the same community. Although Advocate Creative does not research the communities their work affects, the media outlet states that it is an organization with experts in leading a research-driven creative process. However, this research stems from industry research, rather than community based research (H. Sullivan, personal communication, October 23, 2018).
                </p>
                <p>
                    In 2016, Advocate Creative was approached by Inspiration Kitchens, a nonprofit restaurant that trains and employs people who have experienced homelessness and poverty, located in the Chicago neighborhood Garfield Park, to build them a new website. Advocate Creative did not directly acknowledge the Garfield Park community when they worked on this project, however, the ethos of the media outlet is to provide their services to nonprofits, displaying no preferred community or location. Advocate Creative has worked with multiple organizations outside of the Garfield Park community, such as the Charter School Growth Fund located in Colorado and the aforementioned Girls Inc. of Alameda County, located in California <a href="https://advocatecreative.com/work/girls-inc-alameda-county-annual-report" target="_blank"> (Advocate Creative, 2018c). </a> Throughout these projects, there is no mention from Advocate Creative of the communities that these clients are a part of, further showing that the community of their nonprofit client has no real impact on the selection of the client. 

                </p>
                <p>
                    Evan Cauble-Johnson, the Chief Development Officer for Inspiration Kitchens, was “initially drawn to Advocate Creative after seeing their bold, dynamic work on the web” <a href="https://advocatecreative.com/work/world-relief-annual-report-design/" target="_blank"> (Cauble-Johnson, 2018, para 1)</a>, and were felt that the agency “more than delivered on [their] needs by creating an engaging new website that truly captures the spirit of our work” <a href="https://advocatecreative.com/work/world-relief-annual-report-design/" target="_blank"> (Cauble-Johnson, 2018, para 1). </a> Inspiration Kitchens needed a new website to attract customers to their restaurant and catering service, while keeping their mission and message prominent. Advocate Creative encouraged Inspiration Kitchens to consider switching their strategy, to prioritize their food over their mission to attract customers. The new website is responsive, easy to update, and features their food front and center alongside numerous testimonials of satisfied customers. Advocate Creative does not currently track the metric of the websites that they create so there are no direct statistics on whether or not the website benefited the company. However, recent data on Inspiration Kitchen’s website shows that 100% of traffic to the site is organic, just under 50% comes from web searches, 16% from social media, while the rest is from either direct traffic or referrals <a href="www.similarweb.com/website/inspirationkitchens.org." target="_blank"> (SimilarWeb, 2018a). </a>

                </p>
                <p>
                    Although Advocate Creative does not acknowledge the Garfield Park community to give them social power, the community uses their voice to create their own. The most prominent organization with social power in the neighborhood is the GPCC, Garfield Park Community Council. This group of people, made up by those who live in Garfield Park and want to voice their opinions, “focus on renewing the community’s commercial corridors, spurring new housing investment, addressing public safety and wellness, and building connections between neighbors. [Their] programs integrate resident leadership and advocacy to ensure that community members lead neighborhood planning and renewal efforts” <a href="www.gpcommunitycouncil.org/index.html." target="_blank">(Garfield Park Community Council, 2018a, para 2). </a> Their main focus is the people of Garfield Park and they use their social power when they come together to work on projects to improve the neighborhood. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    The members of the Garfield Park community have the freedom of ideas and connections, but lack freedom of resources. As mentioned earlier, the community is active on Facebook to discuss issues, but lack funding and resources to fix all of these problems.  However, the community is working to find ways around their lack of resources to solve issues by using community leadership and social power. “Resident leadership and engagement is one of the most powerful tools against crime and other quality of life issues that prevent Garfield Park residents from enjoying the freedom to walk, shop, and enjoy their homes and community, something taken for granted in other Chicago neighborhoods” <a href="www.gpcommunitycouncil.org/GPCC-Programs/Public-Safety.html." target="_blank">(Garfield Park Community Council, 2018c, para 1). </a> The freedom of coming together as a community gives them the power to combat these issues and improve the neighborhood. 

                </p>
                <p>
                    One suggestion for the Garfield Park community is to work with and become a part of organizations that are specifically interested in giving back to the community. The engagement with these types of organizations could result in more resources for them to better help and improve their neighborhood, and positively affect the community itself. Another suggestion to the community is to be more active on their social media profiles, such as the community's Facebook page. The participation of more people could result in a larger dialogue, and again an increase in resources, that could help the community. The final suggestion to the community is to recognize and acknowledge its power. Changes can and have occurred through the community's involvement in their neighborhood, and if they continue, or increase, this then they will see a bigger impact.
