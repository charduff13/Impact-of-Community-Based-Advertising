                <h3 id=history>History</h3>
                <p> Advocate Creative is a Creative Agency located in Chicago, started in 2012 and founded by Principal and Creative Director Doug Scott. Their past is filled with multiple awards. In the agency’s first year of operations 2012 they won multiple awards, such as the Telly award. Their most notable award is the Webby Honorable Mention. The agency received the award for having an excellent presence online. In total the agency won 135 awards for their work <a href="https://advocatecreative.com/ " target="_blank">(Advocate Creative, 2018d). </a> The Agency primarily operates in the advocacy industry within the Social Services sector, “We are a creative agency for nonprofits and foundations” <a href="https://advocatecreative.com/ " target="_blank">(Advocate Creative, 2018d). </a> This organization has been operating for approximately 6 years and employs approximately 5 people at this single location. Advocate Creative has definitely made a name for themselves. The multiple awards they have won show this, as well as how they are perceived in the world of Communications, “World-changing organizations deserve world-class communications” <a href="https://advocatecreative.com/ " target="_blank">(Advocate Creative, 2018d). </a> Advocate Creative is built off of an outstanding creative foundation, whether it is film makers or graphic designers. They have many different types of creative minds working for them and in total, there are nine employees. Doug Scott is the principal and creative director, Hannah Sullivan is the client services director, Jessie McGrath is the art director, Joel Krogman is the film lead, Johanna Beach is the associate producer, Jon McGrath is the design lead, Megan Kennedy is the producer, Randy Warren is the filmmaker, and Samantha Hovar is the office coordinator. Many if not all of their employees started and or joined Advocate Creative with prior experience in the creative advertisement business because they wanted to join a business that was driven by the want and need to help nonprofit organizations succeed and be heard. This is one of their strongest assets and why they have become so well known. They know how to work with nonprofits effectively, “but while fundraising may be the end result, it should never be the only goal,” said Doug Scott, who also stated that “donors are just one audience an organization must communicate with.” He counsels his clients to consider customers and beneficiaries, partners, volunteers, and journalists. Your targeted audience determines how you should tell the story, he said, explaining that some of his clients tell the same story four or five different ways in order to connect with different audiences. He referenced videos of Pauline Wambeti, a new country director at Nuru International, told in three different ways.” <a href="https://www.devex.com/news/a-critical-skill-for-global-development-professionals-storytelling-89090" target="_blank"> (Cheney, 2017, January 10, para 6). </a> n past campaigns, Advocate Creative has shown how they are so effective. Describing how fundraising has multiple aspects gives us an idea of how they think outside the box. Reaching multiple audiences is the most important part.

                <h3 id=impact1>Impact on Public Opinion</h3>
                <p> Advocate Creative is an advertising agency that exclusively works with nonprofits, because of this every project they take on is positively affecting the community. Many of their clients in Chicago approached them for website creation, one of those clients was The Chicago History Museum. They approached Advocate Creative because they needed a microsite for their newest exhibit celebrating the life and work of America’s first couturier, Main Rousseau Bocher <a href="https://advocatecreative.com/work/chicago-history-museum-making-mainbocher-web-design/ " target="_blank"> (Advocate Creative, 2018b). </a> Their main goal was to educate residents about this Chicago native’s place in history, and to increase attendance of the exhibit.  Advocate Creative designed a site that mimicked the era in which he worked. This idea executed the theme of the exhibit in a fun and educational way. They “featured some of his most iconic creations and provided information for users to plan their visit” <a href="https://advocatecreative.com/work/chicago-history-museum-making-mainbocher-web-design/ " target="_blank"> (Advocate Creative, 2018b). </a> The site was interactive, much like the exhibits at The Chicago History Museum, and allowed viewers to explore his collection, view a short video, and even tweet quotes from the page.

                <p> A screenshot from the webpage (Figure 1.) demonstrates the themed design and informational content displayed by Advocate Creative’s work. This webpage no longer exists so there is no current way to track the impact it had on ticket sales, or the amount of traffic to the page. We assume that the webpage did increase traffic to the exhibit because of the positive review left by the Museum, however, we could not confirm that this is true without proper analytics from the museum or the webpage.
                </p>
                
                <p> Another client Advocate Creative has worked with and impacted is World Relief. “World Relief is an international relief and development agency that empowers local church[es] to serve the most vulnerable” <a href=" https://worldrelief.org/" target="_blank">(World Relief, 2018, para 1). </a> 
                World Relief approached Advocate Creative because their 2016 annual report needed to compellingly communicate the mission, work and vision of the organization to donors and partners. Advocate Creative created a clean and appealing report for the organization that helped them to better express their mission of aiding with disaster response, health and child development, refugee and immigration services, economic development and peace-building. The scope and scale of World Relief’s work touches millions of people in more than two dozen countries and therefore this report directly impacted an extremely influential organization <a href="https://advocatecreative.com/work/world-relief-annual-report-design/" target="_blank">(Advocate Creative, 2018e).</a> This is also confirmed by Charity Navigator, a website dedicated to evaluating nonprofits and providing information regarding their trustworthiness. World Relief received a 92/100 overall as a nonprofit, and a 100/100 for transparency and accurate data sharing, proving that these statistics provided by them to Advocate Creative are trustworthy <a href="www.charitynavigator.org/index.cfm?bay=search.summary&orgid=4765." target="_blank">(Charity Navigator 2018). </a>
                </p>
                <p> Advocate Creative also worked with the nonprofit organization Girls Inc. to create and design the organization’s first ever annual report <a href="https://advocatecreative.com/work/girls-inc-alameda-county-annual-report/" target="_blank">(Advocate Creative, 2018c).</a> <i>Girls Inc</i>  is a nonprofit that focuses on the development of young women by providing them with a combination of long-lasting mentoring relationships, a pro-girl environment and research-based programming. This equips girls to lead fulfilling and productive lives, break the cycle of poverty, and become role models in their community <a href=" https://girlsinc.org/" target="_blank">(Girls Inc, 2018). </a> “As a growing organization, they not only needed to recap their year through photos, stories and statistics, but they needed to introduce potential donors and partners to their work. The book that [Advocate Creative] designed was part annual report and part marketing piece to engage both existing and potential donors” <a href="https://advocatecreative.com/work/girls-inc-alameda-county-annual-report/" target="_blank">(Advocate Creative, 2018c, para 1).</a> Julayne Virgil, CEO of Girls Inc, shared that they “have previewed the annual report to [their] board and select major donors and it has been met with rave reviews! [They] cannot wait until [they] get the mailing out and the website goes live” <a href="https://advocatecreative.com/work/girls-inc-alameda-county-annual-report/" target="_blank">(Julayne Virgil, 2018b, para 1). </a>
	            </p>
                <p> Although there is a lack of information and statistics regarding the traffic to The Chicago History Museums past web page and the impact of the reports they created, Advocate Creative’s client testimonials state that their work had some type of positive effect on their organizations. Therefore the company affected the opinions of their clientele and others such as the board members of <i>Girls Inc. </i>

                <h3 id=connections1>Connections to the Greater Chicago Media Ecosystem</h3>
                <p> AAdvocate Creative is an up and coming agency within the Chicago area that is beginning to make their mark on the Chicago area. They are involved with nonprofit organizations such as <i>Inspiration Kitchens</i>, <i>The Chicago History Museum</i>, and <i>Opportunity Enterprises</i> which are located in and around the Chicago area. TThese three organizations are just a few of the many nonprofit organizations that Advocate Creative works with to better their impact of awareness and attention that these organizations need <a href="https://advocatecreative.com/ " target="_blank">(Advocate Creative, 2018d). </a>
                </p>
                
                <p> In regards to the actual footprint that Advocate Creative is leaving on Chicago, it is little to none. Almost all of their clients are located outside of the Chicago area and are mainly within the California Bay area and Washington DC. With that being said, Advocate Creative started and is located in Chicago. When asked why it is that they have little to no clients within the Chicago area, Hannah Sullivan, the Client Services Director at Advocate Creative stated that it was due to the lack of funds that local nonprofit agencies have to receive their services (H. Sullivan, personal communication, October 9, 2018). 
                </p>
                
                <p> Aside from the physical connections to Chicago’s Media Ecosystem, the people that work for Advocate Creative and are a part of their creative workspace, can be viewed as a way in which their company impacts Chicago’s Media Ecosystem. Advocate Creative employees like filmmaker, Randy Warren, have many years of experience within the Chicago area including the business that Randy owned called <i>Outside The Box, Inc.</i> for over 17 years. A recommendation left on Warren’s LinkedIn account by Frank Rodriguez (November 28, 2007) says, “Randy Warren is a potent asset as a video producer, director and editor. I've worked with him on various projects off and on for the past 20 years and to this day, his talents show no signs of slowing. It's apparent to everyone who works with him that he takes joy in what he does. The top notch results Randy consistently produces insures him a very busy schedule, much to the chagrin of hopeful clients” <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/randy-warren-a643143/" target="_blank">(Rodriguez, 2007, November 28). </a>  Another employee that has held connections and gained experience that has influenced Chicago’s Media Ecosystem is Hannah Sullivan. Hannah began her experience working with nonprofit organizations in college where she attended the University of Missouri and was selected in 2010 to participate as an Events Coordinator for program called “Granny’s House” which was a nonprofit organization. Hannah continued to use her experience when she moved to Chicago and joined Chicago’s Media Ecosystem. She became a Strategist in 2014 for a company called Egg Strategy which is a Marketing and Advertising company within the Chicago area. Hannah was able to gain many experiences as well as furthering her experience with nonprofits. These experiences lead to her beginning with Advocate Creative in January of 2017, as their Strategist and Client Manager for ten months where she then was promoted to the Client Service Director for Advocate Creative in November of 2017 <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/hannah-sullivan-92652638/" target="_blank"> (Sullivan, 2018).</a>
                </p>
               
                <p> The overall outlook of Advocate Creative’s connection to Chicago’s Media Ecosystem is based on the individuals that work at Advocate Creative. Due to the fact that Advocate Creative has a lack of clientele within Chicago and their social media presence is little to none, the company itself is unable to have much of a footprint on Chicago's Media Ecosystem. However, the people that make up Advocate Creative’s team, contribute in their own ways to Chicago’s Media Ecosystem. The media that their employees create in and out of the office, is media that is affecting the Media Ecosystem in Chicago. This is because, the work that Advocate Creative does together, influences each employee individually and those influences become a factor when each individual is creating media aside from Advocate Creative’s work.

            <h3 id=future1>Future Plans</h3>
                <p> The next stage for Advocate Creative is to provide their services to a specific nonprofit organization for an entire year. Since its inception, the media outlet has focused mostly on single projects directed at nonprofits in which they could provide their services, such as brand strategy, video production, website design, and print collateral. However, those projects resulted in a limited amount of time in the collaboration between Advocate Creative and each nonprofit organization the agency worked with. The creative agency would provide the service the agency was hired to do (whether brand strategy, video production, website design, or print collateral – or whatever combination of these the nonprofit seemed to see fit), then Advocate Creative would move on to another project and work with a different nonprofit organization (H. Sullivan, personal communication, October 23, 2018).
                </p>
                
                <p> Even though Advocate Creative supports this business model and the professionals working at the agency have had positive experiences and outcomes, such as awards and press attention, from following this specific pattern, the professionals working at the agency believe that providing their services for a longer period of time would result in a stronger connection with the nonprofit organization. The professionals working at the Advocate Creative also believe that working with organizations for longer will provide the opportunity for the agency to recognize and analyze the outcomes their provided services have long term. Therefore, the plan Advocate Creative developed is to work with a nonprofit organization for a year, as the media outlet believes that a year will be a satisfactory period of time in order to properly have the experience of working long term with a client (H. Sullivan, personal communication, October 23, 2018). Hannah Sullivan did not share what nonprofit organization Advocate Creative was planning to execute this next stage with, nor what standards they would apply when choosing what nonprofit would be the ideal one for the plan. Sullivan did state whether they would maintain the same standards the outlet required when choosing older projects or if new standards would be implemented. However, Sullivan established that the agency already started the process of planning their year-long strategy  (H. Sullivan, personal communication, October 23, 2018).

                </p>
                <p>Besides the plan mentioned, Advocate Creative is also planning on keeping their team small, as Sullivan stated that the agency has previously prospered when working in a professional environment that is not populous. Advocate Creative also plans on developing their own social media presence, as the creation of social media profiles for the media outlet happened very recently (H. Sullivan, personal communication, October 23, 2018).
