                <h2>Conclusion</h2>
                <p>Based on the analysis of the Inspiration Kitchens case study, and the overall company analysis, Advocate Creative is an advertising agency that gives back through their work with nonprofits, but does not connect with their clients, and therefore have very little impact on the media ecosystem. For example, although the media outlet is located in the Garfield Park neighborhood and has worked with nonprofits in the area, Advocate Creative does not engage with the community. As a suggestion, Advocate Creative should participate more actively in their clients’ communities, specifically the Garfield Park community because of the agency’s location, by actively seeking other nonprofits in the area to work with, and engaging with its community members. By doing this, the media outlet will have a better understanding of the community they are serving, and the people that their work affects. Giving them a greater connection to media ecosystem, and proving that their work has an impact.</p>
                <p>Advocate Creative should also track the results of their services. The Inspiration Kitchens case study, and the other case studies, brought to light that the media outlet does not have the numbers to back up how effective their work was or was not. With little to no evidence of organization and community impact, it is not possible to draw conclusions measuring the scope of their work, and therefore diminishes the company’s logos. This, in addition to the company’s lacking presence in the community, leaves the agency seeming to have very little impact.</p> 
                <p>The final suggestion for the agency is to include a page on their website directly discussing the Garfield Park community. With this, members of the community can engage with the media outlet in a more straightforward way. Being close in proximity to companies, like the Hatchery, that are impacting public opinion of the neighborhood, they should be engaging with the Garfield Park community directly, instead of simply through work with one business in the area. Overall, Advocate Creative delivers content to their clients that receive positive testimonials, but lack the concrete evidence of their impact on the media ecosystem and on their clients business, making it difficult to measure their success and trustworthiness.</p>
