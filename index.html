                The production firm Advocate Creative has attempted to make an impact throughout the Chicagoland area with one mission in mind, spread the work of others in the highest quality possible. This study is broken down into two main sections. In Section A, we conduct an evaluation and analysis of the advertising agency Advocate Creative and their impact on the Chicago media ecosystem. We begin with an in depth study of their history, and then move on to discuss how they have molded the public and their future plans. Section B centers around a study of the Garfield Park neighborhood, where Advocate Creative, and one of their clients, are located. This section includes a description of the neighborhood’s history, and their relation to the Chicago Media Ecosystem. We also discuss how the neighborhood is working to better the area and combat issues of public opinion. As Advocate Creative has directly worked with a community bettering organization in the area, we evaluate other resources in the community who are working toward similar goals. This then ties into the social power analysis of the neighborhood. In this we study the neighborhood’s social power and resources, and Advocate Creative’s impact on the neighborhood, by evaluating their work with one nonprofit in the area. In this paper we conclude that although Advocate Creative has worked with a nonprofit in the Garfield Park community, their impact on the area’s media ecosystem is not substantial because of a lack of evidence, and a lack of involvement with the community by the agency.
